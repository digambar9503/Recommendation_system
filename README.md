# Recommendation_system
# A Statistical And Machine Learning Approach For Crop Recommendation 

# Introduction
This project aims to provide a crop recommendation system using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to help farmers make informed decisions about which crops to plant based on various environmental and soil conditions. By leveraging historical data, the system can predict the best-suited crops for a specific location, thus optimizing yield and resource utilization.

# Key Features
-Crop Prediction: Based on environmental factors like temperature, humidity, Ph, rainfall and soil composition.
- Data-Driven Recommendations: Utilizes historical data to suggest the most suitable crops for each region.
- Machine Learning Models: Employs algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Ensemble learning methods for crop prediction.
- User-Friendly Interface: Easy to use for farmers and agricultural analysts.
- Adaptability: Can be modified to include new data or additional crops and regions.
- Visualization: Graphical representation of prediction results to help users understand the data better.

# How to Use

1. Clone the Repository:
   
2. Install the Required Dependencies:
   Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary packages.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells to train the machine learning models and test them with sample data.
 
4. Test the Model:
   You can test the crop prediction by providing sample environmental data (e.g., soil pH, rainfall, temperature).

5. Deploy (Optional):
   You can deploy this model using Flask or Streamline to create a web-based application for real-time crop recommendations.
